# vFoodAssist
As a technology response to Covid-19, vFoodAssist is a mobile application that connects fresh food vendors with consumers. Itâ€™s a platform where vendors can publish their availability of produce along with available slots. Consumers on the other hand can select the vendor closest to their location, select a slot to ensure social distancing, and check the product before confirming.
